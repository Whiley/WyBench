===================================================================

Wybench is a suite of benchmark programs used for testing and
demonstrating the Whiley language.  Here are some details about the
benchmarks:

(micro)

001_average --- Computes the average of a list of integers.

002_fib* --- Computes the first 41 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

003_gcd --- Implements Euclid's algorithm for finding the Greatest
            Common Divisor of two numbers.

004_matrix --- Implements the classical Matrix multiplication
               algorithm.

005_paths --- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the
              single-source shortest paths of a directed graph
              [BROKEN]

006_queens* --- Implements a solution for the N-Queens problem.

007_regex* --- Implements a simple regular expression matcher.

008_scc --- Implements a variant of Tarjan's algorithm for finding
            strongly connected components.

009_lz77 --- Implements LZ77 compression and decompression.

010_sort --- Implements a simple merge sort.

011_codejam --- A solution to test A of the Google Code Jam
                Qualificition round in May 2011.

012_cyclic --- A simple implementation of a fixed-size cyclic buffer.

013_btree --- A simple implementation of a binary search tree.

014_lights --- A simple implementation of the (British) traffic
                lights sequence.

015_cashtill --- A simple example implementing a cash till which
                  computes the change to given to a customer after a
                  purchase.

016_date --- A simple Gregorian Calendar implementation.

017_math --- Some simple math functions.

022_cars* --- A simple model of cars on a bridge between an island and
             the mainland, the aim of which is to ensure that only a
             certain number of cars get onto the island.

023_microwave* --- A simple model of a microwave, the aim of which is
                   to enforce a safety property that the door can
                   never be open when the oven is heating.

(small)

101_calculator --- A simple parser and evaluator for arithmetic
                   expressions.

102_conway --- An implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

103_tetris --- A simple implementation of Tetris.

104_tictactoe --- A simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe (a.k.a
                  Noughts & Crosses).

107_minesweeper --- An implementation of the classic Minesweeper game,
                    including a Graphical User Interface.

(large)

201_convert --- An image convertor which allows files to be converted
                to/from GIF and PNG.  To implement the PNG format, a
                complete implementation of the ZLIB
                compression/decompression standard is provided.

202_chess --- A chess game validitor, which accepts chess games in
              short algebraic notation and checks that they are valid
              according to the rules of chess.

203_jasm --- A Java Bytecode assembler / disassembler.

204_raytrace --- A simple ray tracer [BROKEN]
